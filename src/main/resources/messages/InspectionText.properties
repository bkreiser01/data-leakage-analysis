# General leakage messages
inspectionText.multiTestLeakage.text=Potential multi-test leakage associated with this variable. Avoid reusing the same test data in separate evaluations.
inspectionText.overlapLeakage.text=Potential overlap leakage associated with this variable.
inspectionText.preprocessingLeakage.text=Potential preprocessing leakage associated with this variable.

inspectionText.overlapLeakageSource.text=Potential source of overlap leakage.

# Reminders to perform split before samle and vice versa
inspectionText.splitBeforeSampleReminder.text=Ensure that splitting is done before sampling.
inspectionText.sampleAfterSplitReminder.text=Ensure that sampling is done after splitting.

inspectionText.dataAugmentationWarning.text=Use caution when performing data augmentation.

inspectionText.vectorizerFitWarning.text=Avoid fitting the vectorizer on the training and test data together.

inspectionText.repeatDataEvaluationWarning.text=Avoid using the same data for multiple evaluations.

inspectionText.generalPreprocessingWarning.text=Avoid performing feature selection before split.
inspectionText.generalOverlapWarning.text=Test data must be distinct from training data.

inspectionText.generalWarning.text=Overlap leakage or preprocessing leakage may be originating from this line.
